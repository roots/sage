## Features

* [gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) build script that compiles both Less and Sass, checks for JavaScript errors, optimizes images, and concatenates and minifies files
* [BrowserSync](http://www.browsersync.io/) for keeping multiple browsers and devices synchronized while testing, along with injecting updated CSS and JS into your browser while you're developing
* [Bower](http://bower.io/) for front-end package management
* [asset-builder](https://github.com/austinpray/asset-builder) for the JSON file based asset pipeline
* [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/)
* [Theme wrapper](https://roots.io/sage/docs/theme-wrapper/)
* [HTML5 Boilerplate](http://html5boilerplate.com/)
  * The latest [jQuery](http://jquery.com/) via Google CDN, with a local fallback
  * The latest [Modernizr](http://modernizr.com/) build for feature detection
  * An optimized Google Analytics snippet
* ARIA roles and microformats
* Cleaner HTML output of navigation menus
* Posts use the [hNews](http://microformats.org/wiki/hnews) microformat
* [Multilingual ready](https://roots.io/wpml/) and over 30 available [community translations](https://github.com/roots/sage-translations)

Install the [Soil](https://github.com/roots/soil) plugin to enable additional features:

* Cleaner output of `wp_head` and enqueued assets
* Root relative URLs
* Nice search (`/search/query/`)

## Installation

Clone the git repo - `git clone https://github.com/roots/sage.git` and then rename the directory to the name of your theme or website.

If you don't use [Bedrock](https://github.com/roots/bedrock), you'll need to add the following to your `wp-config.php` on your development installation:

```php
define('WP_ENV', 'development');
```

## Configuration

Edit `lib/config.php` to enable or disable theme features and to define a Google Analytics ID.

Edit `lib/init.php` to setup navigation menus, post thumbnail sizes, post formats, and sidebars.

## Theme development

Sage uses [gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) as its build system and [Bower](http://bower.io/) to manage front-end packages.

### Install gulp and Bower

Building the theme requires [node.js](http://nodejs.org/download/). We recommend you update to the latest version of npm: `npm install -g npm@latest`.

From the command line:

1. Install [gulp](http://gulpjs.com) and [Bower](http://bower.io/) globally with `npm install -g gulp bower`
2. Navigate to the theme directory, then run `npm install`
3. Run `bower install`

You now have all the necessary dependencies to run the build process.

### Available gulp commands

* `gulp` — Compile and optimize the files in your assets directory
* `gulp watch` — Compile assets when file changes are made
* `gulp --production` — Compile assets for production (no source maps).

### Using BrowserSync

To use BrowserSync during `gulp watch` you need update `devUrl` at the bottom of `assets/manifest.json` to reflect your local development hostname.

For example, if your local development URL is `http://project-name.dev` you would update the file to read:
```json
...
  "config": {
    "devUrl": "http://project-name.dev"
  }
...
```
If your local develoment URL looks like `http://localhost:8888/project-name/` you would update the file to read:
```json
...
  "config": {
    "devUrl": "http://localhost:8888/project-name/"
  }
...
```
