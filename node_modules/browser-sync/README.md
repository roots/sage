> Keep multiple browsers & devices in sync when building websites.

Follow [@browserSync](http://www.twitter.com/browserSync) for news & updates.
Check out the [website](http://www.browsersync.io) too.

##Features
1. **Scroll** - I can keep your pages in sync when scrolling.
2. **Forms** - You fill out a form in one browser, I'll copy the data to all the others.
3. **Links** - I'll watch your clicks & and make all the other browsers follow you.
4. **CSS injecting** - I can even watch your CSS files & inject them when they change.
5. **Live Reload** - I can also watch files like HTML and PHP & when they change I can reload all browsers for you.
6. **Built-in Server** - Yep, I can serve static files too if you need me to (uses Connect).
7. **Use with any back-end setup** - Browser-sync includes a proxy option so that it can be used with any existing PHP, Rails, Python, Node or ASP.net setup.

##When is it useful?
It's pretty useful when used with a single browser, watching a CSS file for changes & injecting it. But the real power comes when you're building responsive sites and using multiple devices/monitors because it can keep all browsers in sync & make your workflow much faster.

##Install
```
npm install -g browser-sync
```
##How to use it
There are currently 2 ways to use browser-sync - **with** a config file & **without** a config file. Both options are explained on the following pages.

2. [Command line only (no config file)](https://github.com/shakyShane/browser-sync/wiki/Command-line-only)

## Using Grunt?
