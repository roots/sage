Use this option with `gulp.watch` to keep gulp from stopping every time you mess up your sass.\n\n#### `onSuccess: callback`\n\nPass in your own callback to be called upon successful compilaton by node-sass. The callback has the form `callback(css)`, and is passed the compiled css as a string. Note: This *does not* prevent gulp-sass's default behavior of writing the output css file.\n\n#### `onError: callback`\n\nPass in your own callback to be called upon a sass error from node-sass. The callback has the form `callback(err)`, where err is the error string generated by libsass. Note: this *does* prevent an actual `gulpPluginError` object from being created.\n\n## Source Maps\n\ngulp-sass now generates *inline* source maps if you pass `sourceComments: 'map'` as an option. Note that gulp-sass won't actually do anything when passing `sourceMap: filepath`. Enjoy your source maps!\n\nNB: For those wondering, inline source maps are stuck onto the end of the css file instead of being in a separate map file. In this case, the original source contents are included as well, so you don't have to make sure your scss files are servable.\n\n#Imports and Partials\n\ngulp-sass now automatically passes along the directory of every scss file it parses as an include path for node-sass. This means that as long as you specify your includes relative to path of your scss file, everything will just work.\n\nscss/includes/_settings.scss:\n\n```scss\n$blue: #3bbfce;\n$margin: 16px;\n```\n\nscss/style.scss:\n\n```scss\n@import \"includes/settings\";\n\n.content-navigation {\n  border-color: $blue;\n  color:\n    darken($blue, 9%);\n}\n\n.border {\n  padding: $margin / 2;\n  margin: $margin / 2;\n  border-color: $blue;\n}\n```\n\n",
