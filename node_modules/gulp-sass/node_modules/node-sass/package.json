While we try our best to maintain feature parity with [libsass], we can not enable features that have not been implemented in [libsass] yet.\n\nIf you'd like to see what features are still upcoming in [libsass], [Jo Liss](http://twitter.com/jo_liss) has written [a blog post on the subject](http://www.solitr.com/blog/2014/01/state-of-libsass/).\n\nPlease check for [issues on the libsass repo](https://github.com/hcatlin/libsass/issues) (as there is a good chance that it may already be an issue there for it), and otherwise [create a new issue there](https://github.com/hcatlin/libsass/issues/new).\n\nIf this project is missing an API or command line flag that has been added to [libsass], then please open an issue here. We will then look at updating our [libsass] submodule and create a new release. You can help us create the new release by rebuilding binaries, and then creating a pull request to the [node-sass-binaries](https://github.com/andrew/node-sass-binaries) repo.\n\n## Install\n\n    npm install node-sass\n\n## Usage\n\n```javascript\nvar sass = require('node-sass');\nsass.render({\n\tfile: scss_filename,\n\tsuccess: callback\n\t[, options..]\n\t});\n// OR\nvar css = sass.renderSync({\n\tdata: scss_content\n\t[, options..]\n});\n```\n\n### Options\n\nThe API for using node-sass has changed, so that now there is only one variable - an options hash. Some of these options are optional, and in some circumstances some are mandatory.\n\n#### file\n`file` is a `String` of the path to an `scss` file for [libsass] to render. One of this or `data` options are required, for both render and renderSync.\n\n#### data\n`data` is a `String` containing the scss to be rendered by [libsass]. One of this or `file` options are required, for both render and renderSync. It is recommended that you use the `includePaths` option in conjunction with this, as otherwise [libsass] may have trouble finding files imported via the `@import` directive.\n\n#### success\n`success` is a `Function` to be called upon successful rendering of the scss to css. This option is required but only for the render function. If provided to renderSync it will be ignored.\n\n#### error\n`error` is a `Function` to be called upon occurance of an error when rendering the scss to css. This option is optional, and only applies to the render function. If provided to renderSync it will be ignored.\n\n#### includePaths\n`includePaths` is an `Array` of path `String`s to look for any `@import`ed files. It is recommended that you use this option if you are using the `data` option and have **any** `@import` directives, as otherwise [libsass] may not find your depended-on files.\n\n#### imagePath\n`imagePath` is a `String` that represents the public image path. When using the `image-url()` function in a stylesheet, this path will be prepended to the path you supply. eg. Given an `imagePath` of `/path/to/images`, `background-image: image-url('image.png')` will compile to `background-image: url(\"/path/to/images/image.png\")`\n\n#### outputStyle\n`outputStyle` is a `String` to determine how the final CSS should be rendered. Its value should be one of `'nested'` or `'compressed'`.\n[`'expanded'` and `'compact'` are not currently supported by [libsass]]\n\n#### sourceComments\n`sourceComments` is a `String` to determine what debug information is included in the output file. Its value should be one of `'none', 'normal', 'map'`. The default is `'none'`.\nThe `map` option will create the source map file in your CSS destination.\n[Important: `souceComments` is only supported when using the `file` option, and does nothing when using `data` flag.]\n\n#### sourceMap\nIf your `sourceComments` option is set to `map`, `sourceMap` allows setting a new path context for the referenced Sass files.\nThe source map describes a path from your CSS file location, into the the folder where the Sass files are located. In most occasions this will work out-of-the-box but, in some cases, you may need to set a different output.\n\n### renderFile()\n\nSame as `render()` but writes the CSS and sourceMap (if requested) to the filesystem.\n\n#### outFile\n\n`outFile` specifies where to save the CSS.\n\n#### sourceMap\n\n`sourceMap` specifies that the source map should be saved.\n\n- If falsy the source map will not be saved\n- If `sourceMap === true` the source map will be saved to the\nstandard location of `path.basename(options.outFile) + '.map'`\n- Otherwise specifies the path (relative to the `outFile`) \nwhere the source map should be saved\n\n\n### Examples\n\n```javascript\nvar sass = require('node-sass');\nsass.render({\n\tdata: 'body{background:blue; a{color:black;}}',\n\tsuccess: function(css){\n  \t\tconsole.log(css)\n\t},\n\terror: function(error) {\n\t\tconsole.log(error);\n\t},\n\tincludePaths: [ 'lib/', 'mod/' ],\n\toutputStyle: 'compressed'\n});\n// OR\nconsole.log(sass.renderSync({\n\tdata: 'body{background:blue; a{color:black;}}',\n\toutputStyle: 'compressed'\n}));\n```\n\n### Edge-case behaviours\n\n* In the case that both `file` and `data` options are set, node-sass will only attempt to honour the `file` directive.\n\n## Connect/Express middleware\n\nRecompile `.scss` files automatically for connect and express based http servers\n\n```javascript\nvar server = connect.createServer(\n  sass.middleware({\n      src: __dirname\n    , dest: __dirname + '/public'\n    , debug: true\n    , outputStyle: 'compressed'\n    , prefix:  '/prefix'\n  }),\n  connect.static('/prefix', __dirname + '/public')\n);\n```\n\nHeavily inspired by <https://github.com/LearnBoost/stylus>\n\n## DocPad Plugin\n\n[@jking90](https://github.com/jking90) wrote a [DocPad](http://docpad.org/) plugin that compiles `.scss` files using node-sass: <https://github.com/jking90/docpad-plugin-nodesass>\n\n## Grunt extension\n\n[@sindresorhus](https://github.com/sindresorhus/) has created a set of grunt tasks based on node-sass: <https://github.com/sindresorhus/grunt-sass>\n\n## Gulp extension\n\n[@dlmanning](https://github.com/dlmanning/) has created a gulp sass plugin based on node-sass: <https://github.com/dlmanning/gulp-sass>\n\n## Harp\n\n[@sintaxi](https://github.com/sintaxi)’s Harp web server implicitly compiles `.scss` files using node-sass: <https://github.com/sintaxi/harp>\n\n## Meteor plugin\n\n[@fourseven](https://github.com/fourseven) has created a meteor plugin based on node-sass: <https://github.com/fourseven/meteor-scss>\n\n## Mimosa module\n\n[@dbashford](https://github.com/dbashford) has created a Mimosa module for sass which includes node-sass: <https://github.com/dbashford/mimosa-sass>\n\n## Example App\n\nThere is also an example connect app here: <https://github.com/andrew/node-sass-example>\n\n## Rebuilding binaries\n\nNode-sass includes pre-compiled binaries for popular platforms, to add a binary for your platform follow these steps:\n\nCheck out the project:\n\n    git clone https://github.com/andrew/node-sass.git\n    cd node-sass\n    git submodule init\n    git submodule update\n    npm install\n    npm install -g node-gyp\n    node-gyp rebuild\n\n## Command Line Interface\n\nThe interface for command-line usage is fairly simplistic at this stage, as seen in the following usage section.\n\nOutput will be saved with the same name as input SASS file into the current working directory if it's omitted.\n\n### Usage\n `node-sass [options] <input.scss> [<output.css>]`\n\n **Options:**\n\n      --output-style     CSS output style (nested|expanded|compact|compressed)  [default: \"nested\"]\n      --source-comments  Include debug info in output (none|normal|map)         [default: \"none\"]\n      --include-path     Path to look for @import-ed files                      [default: cwd]\n      --help, -h         Print usage info\n\n## Post-install Build\n\nInstall runs a series of Mocha tests to see if your machine can use the pre-built [libsass] which will save some time during install. If any tests fail it will build from source.\n\nIf you know the pre-built version will work and do not want to wait for the tests to run you can skip the tests by setting the environment variable `SKIP_NODE_SASS_TESTS` to true.\n\n      SKIP_NODE_SASS_TESTS=true npm install\n\n## Maintainers\n\nThis module is brought to you and maintained by the following people:\n\n* Andrew Nesbitt ([Github](https://github.com/andrew) / [Twitter](https://twitter.com/teabass))\n* Dean Mao ([Github](https://github.com/deanmao) / [Twitter](https://twitter.com/deanmao))\n* Brett Wilkins ([Github](https://github.com/bwilkins) / [Twitter](https://twitter.com/bjmaz))\n* Keith Cirkel ([Github](https://github.com/keithamus) / [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Keithamus))\n* Laurent Goderre ([Github](https://github.com/laurentgoderre) / [Twitter](https://twitter.com/laurentgoderre))\n* Nick Schonning ([Github](https://github.com/nschonni) / [Twitter](https://twitter.com/nschonni))\n* Adam Yeats ([Github](https://github.com/adamyeats) / [Twitter](https://twitter.com/adamyeats))\n\n## Contributors\n\nWe <3 our contributors!
