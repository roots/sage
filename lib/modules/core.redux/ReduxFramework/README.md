## Getting Started with Redux ##

ReduxFramework has been built from the groud up to be the most flexible framework around. You can run it as an auto-updating plugin, or embed it inside your plugin or theme. It allows for multiple copies of itself within the same WordPress instance.

## FAQs ##

1. Why should we use ```require_once``` instead of ```get_template_part```?
 * First, because ```get_template_part``` is for... you guessed it, themes! Redux is designed to work with both themes *and* plugins.
 * Second, read [this](http://kovshenin.com/2013/get_template_part/).
2. Why shouldn't we edit ```sample-config.php``` in the plugin directory?
 * Because ```sample-config.php``` will be replaced at each update of the plugin. You will lose all your effort
