/**
 * Represents a pre or post processing filter on HTML Purifier's output
 *
 * Sometimes, a little ad-hoc fixing of HTML has to be done before
 * it gets sent through HTML Purifier: you can use filters to acheive
 * this effect. For instance, YouTube videos can be preserved using
 * this manner. You could have used a decorator for this task, but
 * PHP's support for them is not terribly robust, so we're going
 * to just loop through the filters.
 *
 * Filters should be exited first in, last out. If there are three filters,
 * named 1, 2 and 3, the order of execution should go 1->preFilter,
 * 2->preFilter, 3->preFilter, purify, 3->postFilter, 2->postFilter,
 * 1->postFilter.
 *
 * @note Methods are not declared abstract as it is perfectly legitimate
 *       for an implementation not to want anything to happen on a step
