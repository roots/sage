Configuration naming

HTML Purifier 4.0.0 features a new configuration naming system that
allows arbitrary nesting of namespaces.  While there are certain cases
in which using two namespaces is obviously better (the canonical example
is where we were using AutoFormatParam to contain directives for AutoFormat
parameters), it is unclear whether or not a general migration to highly
namespaced directives is a good idea or not.

== Case studies ==

=== Attr.* ===

We have a dead duck HTML.Attr.Name.UseCDATA which migrated before we decided
to think this out thoroughly.

We currently have a large number of directives in the Attr.* namespace.
These directives tweak the behavior of some HTML attributes.  They have
the properties:

* While they apply to only one attribute at a time, the attribute can
  span over multiple elements (not necessarily all attributes, either).
  The information of which elements it impacts is either omitted or
  informally stated (EnableID applies to all elements, DefaultImageAlt
  applies to <img> tags, AllowedRev doesn't say but only applies to a tags).

* There is a certain degree of clustering that could be applied, especially
  to the ID directives.  The clustering could be done with respect to
  what element/attribute was used, i.e.

    *.id -> EnableID, IDBlacklistRegexp, IDBlacklist, IDPrefixLocal, IDPrefix
    img.src -> DefaultInvalidImage
    img.alt -> DefaultImageAlt, DefaultInvalidImageAlt
    bdo.dir -> DefaultTextDir
    a.rel -> AllowedRel
    a.rev -> AllowedRev
    a.target -> AllowedFrameTargets
    a.name -> Name.UseCDATA

* The directives often reference generic attribute types that were specified
  in the DTD/specification.  However, some of the behavior specifically relies
  on the fact that other use cases of the attribute are not, at current,
  supported by HTML Purifier.

    AllowedRel, AllowedRev -> heavily <a> specific; if <link> ends up being
        allowed, we will also have to give users specificity there (we also
        want to preserve generality) DTD %Linktypes, HTML5 distinguishes
        between <link> and <a>/<area>
    AllowedFrameTargets -> heavily <a> specific, but also used by <area>
        and <form>. Transitional DTD %FrameTarget, not present in strict,
        HTML5 calls them "browsing contexts"
    Default*Image* -> as a default parameter, is almost entirely exlcusive
        to <img>
    EnableID -> global attribute
    Name.UseCDATA -> heavily <a> specific, but has heavy other usage by
        many things

== AutoFormat.* ==

These have the fairly normal pluggable architecture that lends itself to
large amounts of namespaces (pluggability may be the key to figuring
out when gratuitous namespacing is good.)  Properties:

* Boolean directives are fair game for being namespaced: for example,
  RemoveEmpty.RemoveNbsp triggers RemoveEmpty.RemoveNbsp.Exceptions,
  the latter of which only makes sense when RemoveEmpty.RemoveNbsp
  is set to true. (The same applies to RemoveNbsp too)

The AutoFormat string is a bit long, but is the only bit of repeated
context.

== Core.* ==

Core is the potpourri of directives, mostly regarding some minor behavioral
tweaks for HTML handling abilities.
