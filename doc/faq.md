# Frequently asked questions

### Do I need to upgrade my sites each time a new version of Roots is released?

No. You don't normally replace the foundations of a house once it has been
built. There is nothing stopping you from trying to work in the latest changes
but you'll have to assess the costs/benefits of doing so.


### Where can I get help for support questions?

Please ask for help on the
[Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/roots-theme).
