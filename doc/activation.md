# Theme activation

Theme activation is handled by `lib/activation.php`.

After you activate Roots from the WordPress admin you'll be redirected to an activation options page where you can choose to:

### Create static front page	

Create a page called Home and set it to be the static front page. This is normally handled from the Reading settings.

### Change permalink structure

Change permalink structure to `/%postname%/`. This is normally handled from the Permalinks settings.

### Change uploads folder

Change uploads folder to `/assets/` instead of `/wp-content/uploads/`. This is normally handled from the Media settings.

### Create navigation menu

Create the Primary Navigation menu and set the location. This is normally handled from the Menus section under Appearance.

### Add pages to menu

Add all published pages to the Primary Navigation. On a fresh install, this will add the new Home page and existing Sample Page to the navigation.
